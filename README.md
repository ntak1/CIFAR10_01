## Linear Regression Model
Implements Gradient Descent model to estimate the parameters of a given linear function, plot the cost per iteration.

## CIFAR10_01
Just some experiments on Deep Learning to learn Keras and ConvNets. The dataset I will use is CIFAR10, which contains:
60000 images, each with 32x32x3 coloured belonging to 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. The data set is divided in training (50000) and test (10000).
